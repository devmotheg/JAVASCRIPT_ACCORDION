          <p>JavaScript, was originally named Mocha, later it was renamed to
            LiveScript, and then to JavaScript.<br /><br />The language was
            then submitted for standarization to the ECMA International
            Organization. By that time, Netscape didn't allow the use of the
            "JavaScript" name, so the standarized language is named
            ECMAScript.</p>

          <p>You can create end-to-end production full stack apps.<br /><br />With
            JavaScript, you can also build cross-platform mobile apps and
            desktop apps.<br /><br />Now, JavaScript is increasingly being
            used for maching learning and artificial intelligence as well.
            Usually when it comes to machine learning, R and Python are more
            popular but JS is fully capable of doing maching learning and AI
            and has many libraries built specifically for them. It's just that
            JavaScript is not hyped up as much for machine learning as the
            other two.</p>
